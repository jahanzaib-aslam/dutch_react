    <li><strong>You order beautiful flowers online and what do we do?</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <p>When we receive your order, our inspection team will get to work.</p>
  <p>The order is ready in our cold stores, additionally inspected and completely checked for quality, type and any damage. Because we purchase a huge number of transactions of flowers and plants at the flower auction every working day and we are not the only ones, there is a chance that lots will be mixed up or accidentally not delivered. The purchased product may also deviate greatly in quality and be returned by Dutchflowers. Unfortunately, there is a chance that we will occasionally not be able to deliver the product, so don't worry.</p>
  <p>We always look for a suitable solution or a good alternative product :)</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Returns and Returns</li>
  </ol>
  <p>We hope you are happy with your purchase. If for some reason this is not the case, you can return your purchase without any problem. This is possible up to 14 days after receipt of your order.</p>
  <p><strong>Right of withdrawal Returns are not possible for the main product, Living products (flowers and plants, custom work) (in accordance with Article 8.2.d. of the Home Shopping General Terms and Conditions), because they are subject to perishability. For additional products that are not perishable, you can only return them if you are both the orderer and the recipient of the additional item (delivery address = your own address). Returns must be made in accordance with Articles 6 and 7 of the Thuiswinkel General Terms and Conditions. If the consumer has paid an amount, the entrepreneur will refund this amount as soon as possible, but no later than within 14 days after the return or cancellation. Additional Return Instructions: An additional product must be unused and undamaged if reasonably possible. Please ship it in protective packaging. If possible, please include the order number. This speeds up the processing of the return. The order number can be found in the order confirmation email.</strong></p>

  <p>Vases and Pots:</p>
  <p>The customer must check the delivered product at the time of delivery for transport damage and report the number of packages and deviations immediately on the waybill. The customer must also check the quantity and quality of the delivered goods within 24 hours of delivery. However, each product is handmade and therefore has its own unique appearance, with slight color differences and slopes being unavoidable, so this cannot be regarded as a shortcoming. Any defects must be reported by the customer by telephone and/or by email to info@dutchflowers.com, stating reasons and documenting them with photos, no later than within 48 hours of delivery of the delivered goods. In the absence of timely inspection and/or complaint as referred to in this article, the product is deemed to have been received in good condition and Bloemenonline is not obliged to send a replacement product or any compensation.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Guarantee</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The legal warranty applies to all items you purchase from us. This means that an item must be in good condition and function as expected under normal use. It concerns expectations that you can reasonably have about a product. If you receive an item for which, in your opinion, this is not the case, we will be happy to assist you in finding a suitable solution in all reasonableness.</p>
  <p>Living products</p>
  <p>The legal guarantee applies to delivered flowers and plants. This means that a product is or must do what the consumer can reasonably expect from it. Any warranty claim will lapse if the delivered goods have been used for other purposes or treated in a different manner than is normally customary. If quality complaints arise, we request the consumer to send a photo with a description of the complaint to info@dutchflowers.com stating 'quality complaint'.</p>
  <p>Please note:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Indoor and outdoor plants, cut flowers, bouquets, wreaths and discounted items cannot be returned or shipped.</li>
